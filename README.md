This project is similar to the Regex Zip Code lab. It is modified for C#.  It is to demonstrate my 
skills in C# with collections, and with string manipulation using regex.
Challenge: turn a string roughly formatted in JSon-ish fashion representing a list of grocery items into a 
clean, formatted "grocery list" stating each item, how many times it occurs in the list accompanied by the price or prices of said item and number of occurrences of said price.  Using only regex & regex methods, absolutely no methods of the String class.
